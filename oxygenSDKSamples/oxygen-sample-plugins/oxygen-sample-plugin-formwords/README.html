            <p> This plugin capitalizes the first letter in every word in the selected text from the
                document. Only the first letter is affected, the rest of the word remains unchanged.
                If the first character in the word is not a letter then this plugin has no effect.
                The words are considered to be separated by at least one whitespace. </p>
            <p>The plugin uses the following API classes:</p>
            <pre>ro.sync.exml.plugin.selection.SelectionPluginContext;
ro.sync.exml.plugin.selection.SelectionPluginExtension;
ro.sync.exml.plugin.selection.SelectionPluginResult;
ro.sync.exml.plugin.selection.SelectionPluginResultImpl;</pre>
            <p> After installing the plugin it can be accessed through the editor's contextual menu
                by choosing <b>Plugins->Form Words</b>.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>Input:
	this is a sample.
Result:
	This Is A Sample.</pre>
