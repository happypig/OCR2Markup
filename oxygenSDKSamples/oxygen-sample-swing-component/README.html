    <h1>Using oXygen XML Author as a component for building a Java application</h1>
    <section>
      <p>This project can be used as a starting point for creating an oXygen
        Author as a Swing component.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> To access resources from your CMS you can
        either use WebDAV (if your server supports it), or you can write a custom protocol handler
        and plug it into the component using the <code>URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory</code> method.</p>

      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Specify the license key</h3>
        <p>Licensing options:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Request an Author Component development license key from us (support@oxygenxml.com).
            Set this license key (look for a TODO in the Java code) in the
            <code>AuthorComponentSample</code> Java class.</li>
          <li>Use a fixed license key of "evaluation" type - i.e for development only - and put it
            in the file: "src/main/resources/license.key" (the license key string must be the same
            as the one received from oXygen, including start/end markers and line breaks)</li>
          <li>A floating license key, for the production environment. In this case modify the code
            to access the specific license server. See the TODOs from
            <code>AuthorComponentSample.java</code> and <code>Reviewer.java</code> </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Licensing informations can be found <a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-oxygen/topics/component_licensing.html">here</a>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Enabling the logging</h3>
        <p>You can change the verbosity of the logger by modifiying the
          <code>src/main/resource/logback.xml</code></p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Build and deployment </h2>
      <p>To build the entire set of files needed by the component, run the following command in the
        main project directory:</p>
      <pre>
        mvn -pl oxygen-sample-swing-component -am install
        </pre>
      <p>Note that the command has been executed in the root project rather that in the module
        directory. This way, all dependencies of the oxygen-sample-applet module are also built. As
        a side effect, all the modules in the project will also be built. If you do not need all the
        modules, you can remove them from their parent's pom.xml file to speed up the build process.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Running the standalone sample applications</h2>
      <p>You can run the standalone sample using:</p>
      <pre>
      editor.bat
      reviewer.bat
      </pre>
      <p>For other platforms than Windows, use directly the Maven command from the bat files.</p>
