1. DEFINITIONS

   a) "Syncro" means Syncro Soft S.R.L.
   b) "Oxygen" means the specific software products for editing and authoring XML documents, that Syncro have developed as featured on http://www.oxygenxml.com website. Oxygen includes any new releases, upgrades, updates and on-line or electronic documentation.
   c) "Licensee" (or "You") means the individual who or entity that accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License.
   d) An "Add-on" means a software program or a custom configuration framework that works within Oxygen (it cannot operate on its own). Oxygen supports Add-ons to enable third-party developers to create specific abilities which extend Oxygen features. Examples of such Add-ons are: plug-ins, new frameworks for XML document types, customization of an Oxygen framework for a default document type (DITA, DocBook, TEI, etc.) or extensions to access Oxygen XML Eclipse plug-in features from your own Eclipse plug-in.
   e) "Software" means the Oxygen XML Software Development Kit (SDK) which enables you to develop Add-ons or Applications (as defined in section 2.1). The Software is comprised of libraries, source code, APIs, sample code and online or electronic documentation.

2. LICENSE GRANTS
 2.1. Subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Syncro hereby grants You a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to:
      a) Install a reasonable number of copies of the Software on computers owned or controlled by you, to be used internally by you or your authorized users for the sole purpose of internal evaluation, testing and "Development Activity" in strict compliance with the terms stated below. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Development Activity" means the activity to: 
         a) Develop Add-ons designed to function within Oxygen. A license for deploying such Add-ons to end-users is granted royalty fee, under your own terms and conditions.
         b) Integrate the Software with any custom software application that you have developed ("Application") as more explicitly defined in section 3.2.The part of the Software that is integrated in Application is defined as "Author Component" and a license for deploying such Application to end-users is granted according to section 3 ("Author Component").
      b) You may make one copy of the Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only. The backup copy must include all copyright information contained on the original.

3. AUTHOR COMPONENT
 3.1. If you intend to integrate Author Component into your Application, you must register to Syncro and request an Author Component Development Key that will enable you to use the Software for free for twelve (12) months after installation ("Development Period") for Development Activity only. The Development Period may be extended for successive terms of one year subject to written request to Syncro. The Software contains a feature that will automatically disable it at the end of Development Period. Syncro will have no liability to you if this feature disables the Software. 
 3.2. The Application developed by You must be an "end user application". An "end user application" is a specific application program that is licensed to a person or company for personal or business use and not with a view toward redistributing the application or any part of the application, and may be either an application that is used by Licensee internally, or an application that is commercially distributed to end users for their use. An end user of an Application may not modify or redistribute the Application and may not copy it (other than for archival purposes). Licensee's license agreement covering the Application must contain restrictions prohibiting redistribution, modification and copying of the Application. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Syncro, and its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives, from or in connection with damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Syncro on account of you not including these terms in any of your customer license agreements. 
 3.3. Deployment license grant. Subject to all the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including without limitation, the payment of the runtime licensing fees described in section 3 hereof, Syncro hereby grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to reproduce exact copies of the Author Component and include such files in the Application, and to deploy the Application on your owned and controlled computers and networks for use by your employees, contractors and affiliates and/or to commercially distribute the Application, directly and through customary distribution channels, to end users for their use without further distribution. You must purchase a runtime license for each deployment of Application. Such licenses are available only from Syncro and Syncro distributors. For purposes hereof, a "Deployment of Application" includes Name-User Deployments and Concurrent Deployments as hereinafter defined:
      a) Named or Concurrent Oxygen Licenses. If the Application will be used by You internally, You will have the option to buy or use already bought regular Oxygen software licenses that will enable (more than the normal usage conferred by the Oxygen license) the runtime usage of the Author Component as it was integrated into the Application.
      b) Author Component Named-User Deployment. An "Author Component Named-user Deployment" means installation of the Application by You and/or your customers for use by a single named user. The sharing of the Named-user Deployment License by more than one individual is expressly prohibited.
      c) Author Component Concurrent Deployment. An "Author Component Concurrent Deployment" means that You have built a method of concurrency control into the Application so that the number of end users belonging to one of your customers accessing the Application at any one time may not exceed the number of concurrent deployment licenses obtained by You for that customer. For each of your customers You are required to purchase a separate Component Concurrent Deployment license. Concurrent Deployment Licenses are available in perpetual or subscription term (as described in section 3.3.d).
      d) Author Component Subscription Deployment. If You licensed the Author Component on a subscription basis, the end-user right to access the Author Component integrated into your Application is limited to the subscription period that shall be indicated in your accepted order. You agree to take such steps as are appropriate to ensure that after the expiration of the subscription period, the end-user is no longer entitled to use or access the Author Component.
      e) Author Component Applet License. Allows Application built with Software to be deployed to an application server used to directly deploy the Application to end-users to be used from a web-browser. In this case You have to build an access control mechanism so that each end-user that accesses the Application from a web-browser should be authenticated and logged on. The royalty for this license is directly proportional with the number of unique named users that accessed the Application during one month. 
 3.4. You are required to notify Syncro prior to use of the Author Component in the development of any commercial Application. Please send notification by email to: support@oxygenxml.com and provide the following information in the email a) Company name, b) Application name, c) Licensing Options and d) Scheduled Release Date. You will receive an official acknowledgement letter from Syncro within a week of sending your email notification.
 3.5. Evaluation and Demo Versions. If the Application is sold commercially by You, then You may have an evaluation version of the Application that You make available free of charge to prospects, provided the evaluation version expires within 30 days of a prospect's installation of the evaluation version, and provided it is covered by an evaluation license agreement that provides that the prospect may only use it for evaluation purposes. In addition, You may issue a reasonable number of demonstration copies of the Application to your sales and support staff, for their use in connection with selling and supporting the Application. No runtime license fees will be payable for evaluation and demo versions of the Application deployed in accordance with this paragraph. 
 3.6. Prepayment of License Fees. Initially, prepayment is required for all deployment license orders and a separate Deployment License Key will be provided by Syncro for each order to be embedded into the Application to authenticate licensed copies of the Author Component. If You are later approved by Syncro for "Monthly Reporting and Payment" (as defined in section 3.7), Syncro will provide You a Runtime Deployment License Key that can be embedded into your Application and used for any of Your customers, as long as Deployments are reported and paid in a timely manner.
 3.7. If You are approved by Syncro for "Monthly Reporting and Payment", You agree to maintain full, clear and accurate records as to all Deployments of the Application. If You are commercially distributing the Application through distributors or resellers, You will ensure that your distributors and resellers maintain adequate records to reflect all licenses in the Application that are sold or otherwise distributed by such parties. Syncro will send You a monthly deployment report form to complete at the end of each month and You will submit the report to Syncro, within ten (10) days of the close of each calendar month, setting forth the number of Deployments of Application, and the type of Deployment made during such month. If Licensee has new Deployments for the month, Licensee will pay Syncro the applicable runtime license fee. Syncro shall have the right, no more than once during any calendar year, to have an independent certified public accountant inspect the relevant records of Licensee on thirty (30) days notice and during regular business hours to verify the reports and payments required to be made hereunder. Should an underpayment in excess of five percent (5%) be discovered, You shall pay the cost of the audit. If You are more than thirty (30) days late with any payment of amount due hereunder, interest will accrue from the date due until paid at the lesser of (i) 1.5% per month or (ii) the maximum rate of interest permitted by law. All amounts due hereunder are based on United States currency. 
 3.8. Author Component Support and Maintenance Pack.
 3.8.1. A Support and Maintenance Pack ("SMP") is a time-limited right for Author Component technical support, updates, and upgrades, which you may elect to purchase in addition to the corresponding Deployment of Application for your end-user. Technical support only covers issues or questions resulting directly out of the operation of the Author Component. Syncro will not provide you or your end-user with generic consultation, assistance, or advice under any other circumstances.
 3.8.2. If you redeploy the Application with the new major version of the Author Component and if your end-user's Author Component SMP is still in force, he is entitled to this release of the Application, with no additional fee. If you do not purchase SMP for your end-user, he will not be entitled to this release of the Application unless the Author Component update or upgrade will be provided free of charge by Syncro, under certain circumstances, or you will buy an Application Component upgrade for that end-user.
 3.8.3. If you licensed Author Component Subscription Deployment, SMP is included in the applicable subscription fee, and is valid for the entire subscription period.
 3.8.4. For end-users that purchase or already own multiple Deployment of Application licenses, an SMP must be purchased for each license.
 3.9. Certain rights are not granted under this Agreement, but may be available under a separate agreement. Contact Syncro (support@oxygenxml.com) if you would like to sign a Value Added Reseller agreement.
