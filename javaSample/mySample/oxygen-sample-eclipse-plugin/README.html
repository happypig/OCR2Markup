    <h1>Extending the oXygen XML Editor Plugin for Eclipse</h1>
    <p>This project can be used as a starting point for creating an Eclipse IDE plug-in that extends
      the oXygen plug-in for Eclipse. </p>
    <p>You have samples for adding custom actions to the toolbar and contextual menu, about creating
      a custom view and accessing the API behind the oXygen Author mode. </p>
    <p>This sample Eclipse plugin extends oXygen in the following extension points:</p>
    <pre>
   com.oxygenxml.editor.actionBarContributorCustomizer
   org.eclipse.ui.views
    </pre>
    <section>
      <h2>Source code</h2>
      <table>
        <col width="58%" />
        <col width="42%" />
        <tr>
          <td>DILA.eclipse.SampleView</td>
          <td>Starting from it, you can check which pages are active in the opened XML editors,
            modify them or add listeners to notify custom views which can provide additional context
            information. It is possible to access the document model from the Author page directly
            from your plugin, using most of the Authoring API.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>DILA.eclipse.action.CustomActionBarContributorCustomizerImpl</td>
          <td>Showcases adding actions in the oXygen text page contextual menus, in oXygen toolbar
            and author's Outline view.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr></tr>
      </table>
      <p>The extension points are referenced in the plugin.xml file.</p>

      <h2>How to build the project</h2>
      <p>If you want to use this project from Eclipse, or you need to build against a newer version
        of Eclipse: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>make sure you have installed Oxygen XML Editor plugin in your development Eclipse
          IDE.</li>
        <li>remove the "org.eclipse*" dependencies from the pom.xml file.</li>
        <li>convert the project to a plug-in project (in Eclipse, from the project contextual menu:
          "Configure/Convert to Plug-in Projects"),</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Note:</b> This project may be built in the absence of an Eclipse IDE, by use the
        command:</p>
      <pre>mvn install</pre>
      <p>The jar file from the <code>target</code> directory can be copied in the
          <code>dropins</code> folder of an Eclipse installation.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> At build time, the <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file has some of its
        fields replaced with values from the <code>pom.xml</code> (bundle name, bundle version,
        bundle vendor). For the rest of the values make sure you keep them in sync in the two files,
        or adapt the pom.xml to replace others too. </p>
