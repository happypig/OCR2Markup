      <h2>Keep what you need</h2>
      <p>This sample project is modular. You can keep any of the main sample sub-projects and its
        dependencies and delete the rest. Make sure you update also the pom.xml file.</p>
      <p>For instance if you want to develop an Eclipse plugin you could keep the 
          <code>oxygen-sample-eclipse-plugin</code> and delete from the filesystem the other
          <code>oxygen-*</code> projects.</p>
    </section>
    <section><h2>How to build the project</h2><p>All the subprojects can be built
        directly.</p>So, running the
      command<pre>mvn install</pre></section>

        <h2>Oxygen XML Web Author</h2>
        <p> To develop a Web Author integration you can use a developer-friendly project that was created on GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/web-author-component-integration">Web Author Component Integration</a>.</p>
        <p>A detailed description of the new project and more information can be found in its <a href="https://github.com/oxygenxml/web-author-component-integration/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file.</p>
