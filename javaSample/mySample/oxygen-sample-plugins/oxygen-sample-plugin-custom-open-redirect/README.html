        <title>Sample Open Redirect plugin</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <p> This plugin installs a redirect handler for an URL opened in &lt;oXygen. Such a
                plugin must provide an implementation of
                ro.sync.exml.plugin.openredirect.OpenRedirectExtension which can redirect opened
                URLs in Oxygen.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>How the plugin works:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You can decide that when a ZIP archive gets opened a file from the archive must
                    be automatically opened as well.</li>
                <li>When a SVG gets opened it is opened both in the main editor and in the image
                    previewer.</li>
                <li>Open a totally different location from the original selected URL.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
