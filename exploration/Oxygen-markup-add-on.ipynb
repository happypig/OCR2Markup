    "# Oxygen Add-on: AI-Powered Citation Markup\n",
    "\n",
    "This add-on integrates Oxygen XML Editor with your local LLM Flask API to mark up selected citation strings using custom TEI P5 XML tags, as defined in your `ref_markup_optV2.json` action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add-on Structure**\n",
    "   - Create a new Oxygen plugin project.\n",
    "   - Define `plugin.xml` with extension points for editor actions and UI panels.\n",
    "   - Add Java classes for the main action, settings, and preview dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Editor Action: \"AI Citation Markup\"**\n",
    "   - Register an editor action available in the context menu and toolbar.\n",
    "   - When triggered:\n",
    "     - Get the current selection from the XML editor.\n",
    "     - Show a dialog with options: \"Transform & Replace\", \"Preview Diff\", \"Copy Result\".\n",
    "     - On \"Transform & Replace\":\n",
    "       - Send the selected string to the Flask API endpoint (`/ai/chat/completions`) with the appropriate prompt and model.\n",
    "       - Replace the selection with the marked-up XML from the API response.\n",
    "     - On \"Preview Diff\":\n",
    "       - Show a side-by-side diff (original vs. marked-up) in a dialog.\n",
    "     - On \"Copy Result\":\n",
    "       - Copy the marked-up XML to the clipboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Settings UI**\n",
    "   - Add a settings panel accessible from the add-on menu.\n",
    "   - Allow configuration of:\n",
    "     - API endpoint (default: `http://localhost:5000/ai/chat/completions`)\n",
    "     - API key (stored securely)\n",
    "     - Model selection (fetch available models from `/api/models`)\n",
    "   - Save and load settings using Oxygen's preferences API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **API Communication**\n",
    "   - Use Java HTTP client to POST to the Flask API.\n",
    "   - Construct the request body according to the OpenAI-compatible format:\n",
    "     - `messages`: system prompt + user selection.\n",
    "     - `model`: selected model.\n",
    "     - `Authorization`: Bearer API key.\n",
    "   - Parse the JSON response and extract the marked-up XML.\n",
    "   - Handle errors and show user-friendly messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Packaging and Deployment**\n",
    "   - Package the plugin as an Oxygen add-on (`.oxt`).\n",
    "   - Include all resources and dependencies.\n",
    "   - Provide installation instructions for end users.\n",

    "## Example: Add-on UI Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User selects a citation string in the XML editor.**\n",
    "2. **User triggers \"AI Citation Markup\" from the context menu.**\n",
    "3. **Dialog appears:**\n",
    "   - Shows the original selection.\n",
    "   - Options: \"Transform & Replace\", \"Preview Diff\", \"Copy Result\".\n",
    "4. **On \"Transform & Replace\":**\n",
    "   - The add-on sends the selection to the Flask API.\n",
    "   - Receives the marked-up XML.\n",
    "   - Replaces the selection in the editor.\n",
    "5. **On \"Preview Diff\":**\n",
    "   - Shows a side-by-side diff (original vs. marked-up).\n",
    "6. **On \"Copy Result\":**\n",
    "   - Copies the marked-up XML to the clipboard.\n",
    "7. **Settings dialog** allows configuration of endpoint, API key, and model.\n",

    "**Note:**  \n",
    "- The add-on uses the local Flask API (see `localLlmWIntelGPUV2.ipynb`) for AI-powered markup.\n",
    "- Model list is fetched dynamically from the API for user selection.\n",
    "- All communication is secured via API key.\n"
