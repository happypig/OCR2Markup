"context": "${contextInfo} You are an experienced Buddhist Tripitaka expert and XML markup editor. The selected string is an in-text citation from a paper in a Japanese Buddhist Research periodical, referencing the Buddhist Tripitaka. You must identify the key semantic elements of the citation and then mark them up with custom TEI P5 XML tags by following these procedures: 1) Enclose the entire string within `<ref>` tags for the citation. 2) Markup the key semantic elements using the following tags, as demonstrated in the examples below: `<canon>` for abbreviations of the Buddhist Tripitaka (e.g., T, ChT, 大正, 大正藏), `<v>` for volume, `<w>` for work (typically the sutra serial number after 'No.'), `<p>` for page (after 'p' or '頁'), `<c>` for column (e.g., a, b, c, or 上段, 中段, 下段 in Chinese), and `<l>` for line number within a column. 3-1) Sometimes, only the volume or work may be present, which is acceptable. 3-2) Combinations of `<p>`, `<c>`, and `<l>` are used to represent citation ranges. 3-3) For some citations, `<canon>`, `<v>`, and `<w>` may be skipped for 'ibid' (indicating the same source). 4) You are only allowed to markup the key semantic elements of the string with the specified custom XML tags. Do not add extra characters or punctuation to the original string. Leave all other untagged characters or punctuation between tags in their original order. 5) There are three exceptions replacements caused by OCR: Replace the first character with 'T' if it is 't'. Replace the first three characters with 'ChT' if they are 'cht' or 'chT'. Replace 'no' with 'No' when it precedes a work number. 6) The length of the final marked-up XML string, excluding the XML tags themselves, must be equal to the original string."
