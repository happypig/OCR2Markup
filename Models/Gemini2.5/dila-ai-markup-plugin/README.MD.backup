# DILA AI Markup Plugin

An **Oxygen XML Editor Plugin** that provides AI-powered assistance for marking up TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) XML documents with comprehensive UTF-8 validation and multi-language support.

## Overview

This Maven-based Java plugin integrates with Oxygen XML Editor (version 27.0+) to automate the tedious process of manually marking up references### 4. Multi-language Support System (i18n/translation.xml)

#### Resource Bundle Structure
- **English** (en_US) - Default language, fallback for missing translations
- **Simplified Chinese** (zh_CN) - 简体中文完整支持
- **Traditional Chinese** (zh_TW) - 繁體中文完整支持

#### Translation Keys Coverage
- **Menu and UI Labels**: ~50+ keys for interface elements
- **Error Messages**: Comprehensive error message translations
- **Status Messages**: Operation feedback and notifications
- **UTF-8 Tool Messages**: Specialized messages for encoding validation
- **Help and Tooltips**: Contextual help text in all languages

#### Implementation Details
- Uses Java ResourceBundle pattern for i18n
- TEI XML format for translation storage (`translation.xml`)
- Automatic language detection from Oxygen XML Editor locale
- Graceful fallback to English for missing translations
- PluginResourceBundle integration with StandalonePluginWorkspace

### 5. Current Development Status

#### Active Development (v0.3.1)
The plugin is currently undergoing code quality improvements on the `feature/utf8-tool-java` branch:

**Code Cleanup Priorities:**
1. ✅ Removing unused imports (8 imports in DAMAOptionPagePluginExtension)
2. ✅ Removing commented-out dead code (118+ lines across files)
3. ✅ Fixing compilation issues (SAFE_KEY_FALLBACK reference problem)
4. ✅ Removing unused singleton methods (getInstance() never called)
5. ✅ Consolidating duplicate methods (isTextFile() exists in two places)

**Known Issues Being Addressed:**
- **CRITICAL**: `SAFE_KEY_FALLBACK` is commented out but still referenced (lines 447, 454 in DAMAOptionPagePluginExtension)
- Unused `getInstance()` method in DAMAWorkspaceAccessPlugin
- Duplicate `isTextFile()` method in UTF8ValidationService (production code uses Extension class version)
- `scanForNonUtf8Files()` only used in tests, not in production code

**Production vs Test Code:**
- Some UTF8ValidationService methods are only used in test suite (scanForNonUtf8Files, scanPathRecursively)
- Production code uses alternative implementations in DAMAWorkspaceAccessPluginExtension
- All methods kept for comprehensive testing coverage

#### Testing Status
- **70+ Tests**: All passing (100% success rate)
- **Test Files**: 7 test classes covering all major functionality
- **Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, localization tests in XML documents by leveraging AI language models. The plugin is now fully implemented in Java with robust UTF-8 handling, comprehensive testing, and extensive localization support.

## Main Purpose

- **AI-driven markup assistance** for detecting and tagging references in TEI XML documents
- **UTF-8 validation and conversion** tools for ensuring proper text encoding
- **Tag removal** functionality for XML elements
- **Multi-language support** with comprehensive internationalization
- Integration with **OpenAI's API** (or compatible endpoints) for LLM-based text processing

## Plugin Specifications (Gherkin BDD)

### Feature: AI-Powered TEI XML Markup Assistant

```gherkin
Feature: AI-Powered TEI XML Markup Assistant
  As a TEI XML document editor
  I want to automatically markup references and citations using AI
  So that I can efficiently process scholarly documents with proper semantic tagging

  Background:
    Given the DILA AI Markup Plugin is installed in Oxygen XML Editor
    And the plugin is properly configured with valid API credentials
    And I have a TEI XML document open in the editor

  Scenario: Successful AI markup of selected text
    Given I have selected unmarked text containing potential references
    When I click "AI Markup" from the plugin menu
    Then the plugin should send the text to the configured AI model
    And the AI response should contain properly tagged XML elements
    And the result should be displayed in the plugin's result area
    And a "Replace" button should be available
    When I click the "Replace" button
    Then the original selected text should be replaced with the AI-marked version
    And the change should be recorded in the document's undo history

  Scenario: AI markup with invalid API configuration
    Given the API key is not configured or is invalid
    When I attempt to use AI markup functionality
    Then an error message should be displayed in the info panel
    And the user should be guided to check the plugin configuration
    And no changes should be made to the document

  Scenario: AI markup with network connectivity issues
    Given the API key is valid but network connectivity fails
    When I attempt to use AI markup functionality
    Then a network error message should be displayed
    And the user should be able to retry the operation
    And the plugin should not crash or become unresponsive

  Scenario: User reviews and edits AI-generated markup
    Given AI markup has been generated and displayed in the result area
    When I modify the markup text in the result area
    And I click the "Replace" button
    Then the edited version should be used for replacement
    And the original AI response should be preserved for reference
```

### Feature: UTF-8 File Validation and Conversion

```gherkin
Feature: UTF-8 File Validation and Conversion
  As a document processor working with international content
  I want to validate and convert file encodings to UTF-8
  So that all text files are properly encoded for XML processing

  Background:
    Given the DILA AI Markup Plugin is installed
    And I have access to the UTF-8 validation tools

  Scenario: Scan directory for non-UTF-8 files
    Given I have a directory containing files with mixed encodings
    When I select the directory for UTF-8 validation
    Then the plugin should recursively scan all text files
    And it should identify files that are not valid UTF-8
    And it should display a list of non-UTF-8 files with their paths
    And it should show the total count of problematic files

  Scenario: Convert non-UTF-8 files to UTF-8 with backup
    Given I have identified non-UTF-8 files in my directory
    When I choose to convert them to UTF-8
    Then the plugin should create backup files with .utf8backup extension
    And it should detect the source encoding automatically
    And it should convert each file to UTF-8 encoding
    And it should preserve the original file content and structure
    And it should report the conversion results with success/failure counts

  Scenario: Handle encoding detection for common formats
    Given I have files encoded in Windows-1252, GBK, or Big5
    When I run UTF-8 validation
    Then the plugin should correctly identify these encoding formats
    And it should distinguish them from UTF-8 files
    And it should handle encoding conversion appropriately for each format

  Scenario: UTF-8 validation with BOM detection
    Given I have files with UTF-16 byte order marks (BOM)
    When I run UTF-8 validation
    Then the plugin should detect UTF-16 BOM patterns (FF FE or FE FF)
    And it should correctly identify these files as non-UTF-8
    And it should handle the conversion while removing or handling BOMs properly

  Scenario: Large file and directory processing
    Given I have directories with hundreds of files including large files
    When I run UTF-8 validation
    Then the plugin should process files efficiently without memory issues
    And it should skip binary files automatically
    And it should handle files larger than 50MB appropriately
    And it should provide progress feedback for long operations
```

### Feature: Multi-Language Support and Localization

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Language Support and Localization
  As an international user of the plugin
  I want the interface to display in my preferred language
  So that I can use the plugin effectively in my native language

  Background:
    Given the DILA AI Markup Plugin supports multiple languages
    And the translation files are properly configured

  Scenario Outline: Interface language switching
    Given Oxygen XML Editor is configured for <locale>
    When I open the plugin interface
    Then all menu items should display in <language>
    And all button labels should display in <language>
    And all error messages should display in <language>
    And all tooltips should display in <language>

    Examples:
      | locale | language               |
      | en_US  | English                |
      | zh_CN  | Simplified Chinese     |
      | zh_TW  | Traditional Chinese    |

  Scenario: Fallback to English for missing translations
    Given a translation key is missing in the current language bundle
    When the plugin needs to display that message
    Then it should fall back to the English version
    And it should not crash or display raw translation keys
    And it should log the missing translation for developer reference

  Scenario: UTF-8 character handling in all languages
    Given I am using Chinese language interface
    When I process XML documents with Chinese characters
    Then the plugin should handle Chinese text correctly in all operations
    And UTF-8 validation should work properly with Chinese content
    And AI markup should preserve Chinese characters accurately
```

### Feature: Plugin Configuration and Preferences

```gherkin
Feature: Plugin Configuration and Preferences
  As a plugin user
  I want to configure API settings and preferences
  So that I can customize the plugin behavior for my workflow

  Background:
    Given I have access to Oxygen XML Editor preferences
    And the DILA AI Markup Assistant preferences page is available

  Scenario: Configure API credentials and models
    Given I open the plugin preferences page
    When I enter a valid OpenAI API key
    And I specify the fine-tuned model names for parsing and detection
    And I save the preferences
    Then the settings should be stored securely in Oxygen's options storage
    And the API key should be encrypted/protected
    And the model settings should be available for plugin operations

  Scenario: Validate API configuration
    Given I have entered API configuration in preferences
    When I test the API connection through the plugin
    Then the plugin should verify the API key is valid
    And it should confirm the specified models are accessible
    And it should provide clear feedback on configuration status

  Scenario: Handle missing or invalid configuration
    Given the plugin preferences are not configured or invalid
    When I attempt to use AI markup functionality
    Then the plugin should detect the missing configuration
    And it should provide clear guidance on what needs to be configured
    And it should offer a direct link to the preferences page
```

### Feature: Error Handling and Recovery

```gherkin
Feature: Error Handling and Recovery
  As a plugin user
  I want the plugin to handle errors gracefully
  So that I can continue working even when issues occur

  Scenario: Handle API rate limiting
    Given I make multiple rapid API requests
    When the API returns a rate limit error
    Then the plugin should display an appropriate message
    And it should suggest waiting before retrying
    And it should not lose the user's work or selections

  Scenario: Handle malformed API responses
    Given the API returns an invalid or incomplete response
    When the plugin processes the response
    Then it should detect the malformed response
    And it should display a meaningful error message
    And it should not crash or corrupt the document

  Scenario: Recovery from plugin exceptions
    Given an unexpected error occurs in plugin operations
    When the error is caught by the plugin's exception handling
    Then the error should be logged with sufficient detail
    And the user should receive a friendly error message
    And the plugin should remain functional for subsequent operations
    And the document should remain in a consistent state
```

### Feature: Document Integration and Workflow

```gherkin
Feature: Document Integration and Workflow
  As a TEI XML document editor
  I want seamless integration with my document editing workflow
  So that I can efficiently process documents without disruption

  Scenario: Text selection and replacement workflow
    Given I have a TEI XML document with unmarked references
    When I select a paragraph containing potential citations
    And I trigger AI markup processing
    Then the plugin should preserve the document structure
    And it should maintain proper XML formatting
    And the replacement should integrate seamlessly with existing markup
    And undo/redo functionality should work correctly

  Scenario: Handle complex XML structures
    Given I select text that spans multiple XML elements
    When I apply AI markup
    Then the plugin should handle complex nested structures correctly
    And it should preserve existing XML attributes and namespaces
    And it should generate valid XML markup that integrates properly

  Scenario: Batch processing workflow
    Given I have multiple sections that need markup
    When I process them sequentially with the plugin
    Then each operation should be independent and reliable
    And the plugin state should be properly maintained between operations
    And document changes should be tracked correctly in the undo history

## Current Development Branch

### Branch: `feature/utf8-tool-java`
**Status**: Active Development (v0.3.1-SNAPSHOT)

**Objectives:**
1. **Code Quality Cleanup** - Remove unused and redundant code identified through comprehensive analysis
2. **Bug Fixes** - Resolve compilation issues (SAFE_KEY_FALLBACK references)
3. **Architecture Optimization** - Streamline codebase for better maintainability
4. **Documentation Updates** - Keep README current with development progress

**Planned Removals:**
- ❌ 8 unused imports in `DAMAOptionPagePluginExtension.java`
- ❌ ~118 lines of commented-out dead code
- ❌ Unused singleton accessor `getInstance()` in `DAMAWorkspaceAccessPlugin`
- ❌ Duplicate `isTextFile()` method in `UTF8ValidationService` (production uses Extension version)
- ❌ Unused constant `SAFE_KEY_FALLBACK` (currently causing compilation issues)

**Code to Keep (Test Support):**
- ✅ `UTF8ValidationService.scanForNonUtf8Files()` - Used in 5 test cases
- ✅ `UTF8ValidationService.scanPathRecursively()` - Supports test infrastructure
- ✅ All test classes and resources

**Expected Outcome:**
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase (~200 lines removed)
- No compilation warnings or errors
- 100% test pass rate maintained
- Improved code clarity for future development
