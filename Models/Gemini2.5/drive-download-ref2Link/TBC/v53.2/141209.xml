〓n the order of the compilation of the abhidhammapitaka and the khuddakanikaya Norihisa baba 1.Introduction although there is no controversy among scholars in the assumption that the first four nikayas are prior in the order of compilation to both the abhidhammapitaka) (ap) and the khuddakanikaya2)kn),it still remains unclear with regard to the order of the compilation of the ap and the kN. this paper, on the basis of the analysis of relevant accounts found in the commnentaries on the first four nikavas cFfn sumaigulavilusim, pupanccisuduni, saratthappakasimi, manorathapirami), aims to elucidate the order of these two coipuses of texts. while these four coimmentaries, as Such, were compiled in the fifth century ce,as they are regarded as having originated in earlier sources, called Sihalatthakatha, they, in fact, contain feferences to the different recensions of the ap and KN, apparently earlier than the date. 2.the structure of the abhidhammapitaka and the khuddakanikaya The pali canon, in the present form, conprises both the abhidhammapitaka, con-sisting of seven kinds of texts (hummmesanguni, vibhangu, dhatukutho, puggalapannat-ti, kuthavatthu, yamaka, ptthcna) and the khuddakanikaya, of fifteen khuddukapatha, dhcmnapaulg, 〓ccnu, itivuftckg, suttcnipcta, vimavcfthu, petavofthu, thercgathg, they-igotha, jjutaku, nidclesa, pufisambhicamagg, apudena, budchavamisa, curiyapituka ). This structure of the ap and the kN, however, dose not correspond to that shown in the descriptions of them in the commentaries, which difference alludes to the change of the ideas of the ap and the kn in the course of the history of text's transmission. Each comnentary on the first four nikayas explains these two texts as follows. a. the sumanigulavilus14-29) identifies the seven texts of the ap and the  〓 the order of the compilation of the abhidhammapitaka and the khuddakanikaya (n. bba) thirteen of kN, exactly in the same way as shown above, but it categorizes the thirteen books in the name of "khuddakagantha", not of "kuddhakanikaya". note-worthy at this point is the difference found in between the reciters of the dighani-kaya (dighabhanaka) and those of the Majjhimanikaya (majhimabhanaka ), the former claimns that the "khuddakagantha" should be included in the ap, while the latter asserts that it should be included in the suttapitaka, together with the cariyapitaka, apaduna, and buddhvamsa. B. the sumaiigalavilasim7.10-16) regards the same seven texts as belonging to the ap, and the same fifteen books as being categorized into the kN. This is the only example that shows the exact correspondence to the present construction of the KNin the cFFN. however, as e. lamotte)has pertinently proved, in the parallel passage in the chinese translation of the commentary on the vinaya, "Shan jan pi po sha(善見律毘婆沙)",only fourteen books are shown as belonging to the kN(<ref xml:id="r1" checked="0"><ptr href="https://cbetaonline.dila.edu.tw/T04n0193_p0077a01"/><canon>T</canon> 〓<v>4</v>.<p>77</p>-<l>13</l></ref>).this description of The sumangulauilasin can be fegarded as having been redacted in comparatively later time. c. The papancasudam 29)explains that the buddha hinself considered the seven texts as being categorized in the ap, while The sumangalavilasin37- 〓66.6) enumerates only twelve books, and that not as the kN but as "the word of Buddha that is not to be called Sutta". d. the manorathapur11-20), while showing the seven texts as belonging to the ap, mentions the jataka not as the kn but as the text that belongs neither to the suttapitaka noi the ap The examination in the above can be shown in the diagram  and 2as below.  〓 the order of the compilation of the abhidhammapitaka and the khuddakannikava (n. baba ※the number of each text in the diagram indicates the order of each text, listed in the cFFN. ※"eans the absence of the text. ※the number in parentheses in line "B" shows the order of each text given i "Shanjianlu pi po sha"(善見律毘婆沙) 3.conclusion 〓nthe cFFN, while the seven texts of the ap were consistently fixed, the number and the nane of the texts belonging to kN, fifteen in the present form, was no1 at a11 firmly established at that time, and, anong other things, they were not ever called "KN".this clearly shows that the emergence of the idea of the knas con-taining the fifteen texts postdates that of the establishment of understanding of the apas having the seven texts. given that the ap was composed later than the first four nikayas, the order of composition of the pali canon is logically as follows. the  〓n the order of the compilation of the abhidhammapitaka and the khuddakanikaya (N. baba) iirst Four nikayasbhidhammapitaka(7texts)khuddakanikaya (15texts) (references and abbreviations)References to pali texts are to the pali text Society aditions. ap abhidhammapitaka. kn. khuddakanikaya. cFFn. the commentaries on the first four nikayas.
