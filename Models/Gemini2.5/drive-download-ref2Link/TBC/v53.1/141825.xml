journlof indicn a budchisf studies vol.53,no.i,december(11) durvekamisra s Reference to a jaina Theory Kivokuni Shiga in the hetubindutikuloka, durvekamisra (ca.970-1030) refers to the jaina refuta tion of kscnikutvcmumang. although this polemic between Jains and buddhists is a crucial issue, only few attempts have so far been made to it. the purpose of this paper is to examine the jaina fefutation and theif own standpoint by analyzing the passages introduced in and to locate them in the history of Jaina logic by coparing them to other jaina texts. Tle oppoinent begins by claiming that existence (sattva) as the logical reason fol inferring momentariness kmiketvc) is contradictory: 〓sincc the [logical reason] whicl jrovcs that cvcry cntity is ncither non-imomcntary nor momentary provcs the opposite of thc propcrty to bc provcd, it is just contradictory. other words, he maintains that existence is contradictory because it does not prove one aspect of entity but ir fact manifold aspects cnekuntikctvc). here a certain jaina logicians statement is bortowed:〓n the vaecg, Syadvadakesarin)stated: every cntity is manifold bccaust of cxistencc, othcrwisc (if not manifold) how could causal efficiency (arthakriva ) occur The use of saftvg as the logical reason and the term arthakripd in this proof make us assune that Svadvadakesarin knew dharmakirti s sattvanumcna and expressed his own idea by replacing ksanikatvg with anekantikatvc. we can find similar for-mulations in other jaina works, such as SVin3,2, psamv113,24f, taS2,2 〓T3.38f and rd352,f. of these, the example of pnT is noteworthy since the proof of manifoldess is presented as an inference by means of intrinsic pervasion (cntar vrcpti)) this situation is simmilar to sattvanumana in terms of formulating an inference in which the logical subiect includes a11 cases and exanples cannot be offered. furthermore, it may be assummed that the inference of manifoldness ahd the refutation of sattvamumana are closely linked for the jaina logicians. after his statemnent of the anekuntatvg-proof, the jaina logician, supposedly a  commentator on the vadamykt), tries to justify it as follows "from thc above, it is shown that thc valid cognition which ncgates [thc logical rcasonl in the oppositc (viparyave badhakapramana) is capable [of proving] (samnarthaka) on the ground of impos-sibility otherwisc (ampathanupapatti)5)by the following logic: what possesses [thc single characteristic of] impossibility otherwisc is accepted as a  valid] logical rcason.)both cx-imples might cxist or not, for thesc [cxamples] arc not thc cause.7two problems need to be clarified here. the first concerns the relationship between the two concepts, badhakapramana and ayathamupapatti. one of the clues to solving this problenr is found in akalaika's Svin"when there is an exclusion [through] the valid cognitior which negates the presencc of a logical rcasonin the dissimnilar, thc logical rcason is endowcd with capability solely on the ground of impossibility otherwise.9)or the jaina logicians lhe fact that a logical reason possesses the single characteristic of impossibility oth-arwise is the essential element for correct inference. if a logical reason meets the el-ement, the validity of the logical reason can be confirmed also by badhakupramanc which the buddhists adopt as the means of ascertainnent of pervasion in the case of svabhavahetu. the second concerns the purpose of citing patrasvamin's verse Judging from the first half of the verse, the word anvathanupapatti, which is founc iust before the verse, is used at the level of the characteristic of logical reason rathel than at the level of the relation between two concepts like vvapti.10) The second half. on the other hand, supports the jaina view that the anekuntatv-proof does not need or cannot have both examples and is established only through antar pvapti as sccr i1T3.38f. according to durvekamisra, the jaina logician sets two alternatives. (a) a mo-mentary thing has the nature of producing a effect at the tinne of its ow existence, or (b) it has the nature of producing an effect at a different time.ll) alternative (a) would lead to the unfavourable conclusion that the whole world would occur at a single noment if a momentary thing produced an effect only at the tine of its own existence.12) namely, when a certain causeproduces a certain effect (at the same time as itss existence, the effectis a cause of another effect 〓y),and so forth thus, everything would be linked and produced at a single ime.13)furthermore, even though a monentary thing has the nature of producing an effect only at the monent of its ow existence, effects are not produced then but  durvckamisra s rcfcrencc to a jaina thcory (k. shiga)(13 at a different time.i the same maniner, even though a permanent thing has the capability of producing effects at any time, the effects in fact occur gradually anc slowly (vilemb vilembiu). therefore, the way in which a momentary thing produces effects doesiot ddiffey fro the waywhich a pcrinalneint thing does, and there is no difference betweei the oinentary and the noimentary i that there is no activity raparata) at the second moment14)alternative (b) is included in the above-mentioned arguiment, and this forns the jaina standpoint. Akalanka (ca.720-780) also refutes sattvantmana. his well-defined descriptions are found in his NVinf and34NVin4,for example, he states 〓xis. tcncc (seittva ), causal efficicncy (crthakria) and othcr propcrtics of cntity whcn [proving] momentary dcstructionnakscrrc ) are apparcnt logical rcasons called the contradictory for they provc transformatio (parinathe argumentation in these three verses las much in common with those of. The reason for classifying the logica reaso sattvc and others as contradictory is that they are correctly connected with parinama on account of the presence of the activity (kriva) inparinama.)it is t be noted that the term anekantiki is replaced here with parinama.iv 12,-10,however, akalanka argues a bit differently. the points absent ia are as follows:() the nature of a momentary thing is not ascertained; (2) therefore, the ausal relation is lot established through perception and no-perception like iso-lated obiects where no valid cognition functions. and according to him, as long as one approves of the ksanabhanigd-theory, the definition of the causal relationwhat 〓curs only when somethingxists is thc cffcct of x, and x is the causc.17))is not establisled since cause and effect would occur simultaneously. this reasoning is indirectly linked to alternative (a)i. The jaina logicians insist that existence (sattva) is a contradictory logical rea-son and try to prove manifoldness anekuntarva) by means of the very same logical reason. it is fevealed that the refutation of ksamikatvanumana and the anekantatv proof are two sides of the sane coin. the jaina logicians are aware of logical af-finity betweel cyathanupapatti and bddhckapramana and do not deny the latter, which was first proposed by dharnakirti. asa result of the comparison between the view ibaad that of akalaika, one ca safely state that the theoretical preparation for refuting sattvanumana was already in place at least at the time of  Akalanka, and that the method of the fefutationiabasically corresponds to Akalankas. ドi would like to express my gratitude to dr. robert kritzcr for correcting my english. 〓ny errors that remain arc imy own.
