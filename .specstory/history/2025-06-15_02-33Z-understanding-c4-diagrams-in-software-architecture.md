what is C4 diagram?

_**Assistant**_

A **C4 diagram** is a hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams that provides different levels of abstraction for visualizing software systems. Created by Simon Brown, C4 stands for **Context, Containers, Components, and Code**.

## The Four Levels:

### 1. **Context Diagram (Level 1)**
- Shows the software system in scope and its relationship with users and other systems
- Highest level view - "big picture"
- Shows who uses the system and what other systems it interacts with

### 2. **Container Diagram (Level 2)**
- Zooms into the software system to show containers (applications, databases, microservices, etc.)
- Shows the high-level technology choices
- Containers are separately deployable/runnable units

### 3. **Component Diagram (Level 3)**
- Zooms into an individual container to show components
- Shows how a container is made up of components and their interactions
- Components are groupings of related functionality

### 4. **Code Diagram (Level 4)**
- Shows how a component is implemented at code level
- Can be UML class diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, etc.
- Most detailed level - often generated from code

## Key Benefits:
- **Progressive disclosure** - start simple, add detail as needed
- **Common vocabulary** for teams
- **Tool agnostic** - can be drawn with any diagramming tool
- **Supplementary diagrams** can be added for specific concerns (deployment, dynamic views, etc.)

C4 diagrams are particularly useful for documenting microservices architectures and helping teams understand system structure at different levels of detail.
