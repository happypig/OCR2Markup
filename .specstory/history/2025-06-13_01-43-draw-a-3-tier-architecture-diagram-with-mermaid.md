_**Assistant**_

I'll create a 3-tier architecture diagram using Mermaid. Since you have a drawio file, I'll replace its content with a Mermaid diagram.

## Step-by-step solution:
1. Replace the existing drawio content with a Mermaid diagram
2. Create a 3-tier architecture showing Presentation, Business Logic, and Data tiers
3. Include typical components for each tier with connections between them

### [architecture.drawio](file:///c%3A/Project/OCR/doc/architecture.drawio)

Replace the existing drawio content with a Mermaid 3-tier architecture diagram.

````mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Presentation Tier"
        UI[Web Interface]
        API[REST API]
        Mobile[Mobile App]
    end
    
    subgraph "Business Logic Tier"
        AppServer[Application Server]
        BusinessLogic[Business Logic]
        AuthService[Authentication Service]
        OCREngine[OCR Processing Engine]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Tier"
        Database[(Database)]
        FileStorage[(File Storage)]
        Cache[(Cache)]
    end
    
    UI --> API
    Mobile --> API
    API --> AppServer
    AppServer --> BusinessLogic
    AppServer --> AuthService
    BusinessLogic --> OCREngine
    BusinessLogic --> Database
    OCREngine --> FileStorage
    AuthService --> Database
    BusinessLogic --> Cache
