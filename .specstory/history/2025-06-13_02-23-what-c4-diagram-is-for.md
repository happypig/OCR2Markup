what C4 diagram is for?

_**Assistant**_

C4 diagrams are a set of hierarchical software architecture diagrams that help visualize the structure of software systems at different levels of detail. C4 stands for Context, Containers, Components, and Code.

The four levels are:

1. **Context (Level 1)** - Shows how your system fits into the world around it, including users and external systems
2. **Containers (Level 2)** - Shows the high-level technology choices and how responsibilities are distributed across them
3. **Components (Level 3)** - Shows how a container is made up of components, their responsibilities and technology details
4. **Code (Level 4)** - Shows how a component is implemented (optional, often just use IDE-generated diagrams)

**Purpose:**
- Provide a common vocabulary for software architecture
- Make architecture documentation more accessible to different audiences
- Show different levels of abstraction for different stakeholders
- Bridge the gap between high-level architecture and detailed implementation

**Benefits:**
- Easy to understand and create
- Scales from big picture to detailed views
- Uses simple notation (boxes and lines)
- Focuses on static structure rather than complex UML
- Good for onboarding new team members and communicating with stakeholders

C4 diagrams are particularly useful for documenting microservices architectures, web applications, and any software system where you need to communicate structure to both technical and non-technical audiences.
