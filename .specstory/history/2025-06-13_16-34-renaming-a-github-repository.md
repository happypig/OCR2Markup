_**Assistant**_

Yes, it's possible to change the name of a GitHub repository! Here's how you can do it:

## Steps to rename your repository:

1. **Navigate to your repository** (happypig/OCR)
2. **Go to Settings** - Click the "Settings" tab at the top of your repository page
3. **Scroll to Repository name** - In the "General" section, you'll see a "Repository name" field
4. **Enter the new name** - Type your desired repository name
5. **Click "Rename"** - Confirm the change

## Important considerations:

- **URLs will change**: The repository URL will change from `github.com/happypig/OCR` to `github.com/happypig/NEW_NAME`
- **Automatic redirects**: GitHub automatically redirects from the old URL to the new one for a while
- **Update local clones**: You'll need to update the remote URL in any local git clones:
  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/happypig/NEW_NAME.git
  ```
- **Update references**: Any bookmarks, documentation, or external links pointing to your repo should be updated

## Repository naming rules:
- Repository names are case-insensitive
- Can contain letters, numbers, hyphens, periods, and underscores
- Cannot start with a period or hyphen
- Must be unique within your account

The rename process is immediate and shouldn't affect your repository's content, issues, or pull requests.
