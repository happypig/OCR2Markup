# Comparison of GPT model versions (2025-09-21 04:03Z)

_**User (2025-09-21 04:05Z)**_

what's the difference between GPT 4.1, GPT 4o and GPT 5 mini

I can see you're working on a JavaScript plugin for Oxygen XML Editor that integrates with AI services. However, your question about GPT models isn't related to the code in your active file.

Regarding your question about GPT models:

**GPT-4.1** - This isn't an official OpenAI model designation. You might be thinking of GPT-4 Turbo or other variants.

**GPT-4o** - This is OpenAI's multimodal model that can process text, images, audio, and video. It's faster and more cost-effective than GPT-4, with improved reasoning capabilities and the ability to handle multiple input types simultaneously.

**GPT-5 mini** - This doesn't appear to be an official OpenAI model. You might be thinking of:
- **GPT-4o mini** - A smaller, faster, and more affordable version of GPT-4o
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo** - An earlier, more cost-effective model

The main differences typically involve:
- **Performance**: Larger models generally have better reasoning and comprehension
- **Speed**: Smaller models are faster but may sacrifice some capability
- **Cost**: Smaller models are more affordable per token
- **Multimodal capabilities**: Some models can handle images/audio, others are text-only

If you're looking to integrate different AI models into your plugin, you'd need to update the API endpoint and model parameters in your code where you make the HTTP request to the AI service.

what's the difference between GPT 4.1, GPT 4o and GPT 5 mini when choosing in the github copilot?

I am GitHub Copilot.

Summary:
GPT-4.1: Higher‑quality reasoning / coding variant. Prioritizes accuracy, richer chain-of-thought style internal reasoning. Slower and higher cost than 4o. Use for complex refactors, tricky bugs, multi‑file architectural help.
GPT-4o: General flagship multimodal (text, image, audio). Good balance of quality, latency, and cost. Default for most coding, chat, and explanation tasks.
GPT-5 mini: Lightweight next‑gen (if enabled in your tenant). Faster than 4.1 and (usually) 4o, cheaper, upgraded reasoning over earlier “mini” tiers, but below future full GPT‑5 class models in depth. Good for rapid iterations, boilerplate generation, smaller feature scaffolds.

Key selection guidelines:
- Deep reasoning / ambiguous spec: GPT-4.1
- Everyday coding / explanations / multimodal: GPT-4o
- Fast draft / low latency / many quick calls: GPT-5 mini
- Cost sensitivity: GPT-5 mini (usually) < GPT-4o < GPT-4.1
- Latency: mini fastest, 4o middle, 4.1 slowest
- Hallucination resistance: 4.1 ≥ 4o > mini
- Long multi-step refactors: 4.1
- Iterative prompt tinkering: mini
- Mixed media (screenshots, diagrams): 4o (or 4.1 if quality outweighs speed)

If a listed model isn’t visible, it may be in preview or not enabled for your org. Hover tooltips in Copilot model picker for current token pricing and limits.
