# Difference between Java class and interface (2025-09-15 03:02Z)

What's the difference between Java class and interface

---

_**Assistant**_

In Java, both classes and interfaces are fundamental concepts, but they serve different purposes.

### Class
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines state (fields or variables) and behavior (methods) that the objects of that class will have.

*   Can be instantiated to create an object (e.g., `MyClass obj = new MyClass();`).
*   Can contain constructors.
*   Can have instance variables and methods with full implementation.
*   A class can extend only one other class (single inheritance).
*   A class can implement multiple interfaces.

### Interface
An **interface** is an abstract type that is used to specify a contract that classes must implement. It's a collection of abstract methods.

*   Cannot be instantiated directly.
*   Does not have constructors.
*   Traditionally, it only contained method signatures (abstract methods) and constant fields (`public static final`).
*   Since Java 8, interfaces can also contain `default` and `static` methods with implementations.
*   A class can implement multiple interfaces.
*   An interface can extend multiple other interfaces.

### Key Differences Summary

| Feature | Class | Interface |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Blueprint for objects. | A contract for classes to follow. |
| **Instantiation** | Can be instantiated. | Cannot be instantiated. |
| **Constructors** | Has constructors. | Does not have constructors. |
| **Methods** | Can have both abstract and concrete methods. | Primarily abstract methods, but can have `default` and `static` methods. |
| **Variables** | Can have instance variables. | Variables are `public static final` by default. |
| **Inheritance** | Can extend only one class. | Can extend multiple interfaces. |
| **Implementation**| Can implement multiple interfaces. | Cannot implement another interface (it extends it). |

how to utilize PluginResourceBundle based on the above link?

_**Assistant**_

Based on the Oxygen SDK Javadoc, you can use `PluginResourceBundle` to simplify internationalization (i18n) in your plugin. This approach replaces your manual XML parsing with a more robust, standard Java mechanism.

Here is how you can refactor your `dila-ai-markup.js` to use `PluginResourceBundle`:

1.  **Create `.properties` files:** Instead of `translation.xml`, you will use standard Java resource bundle files. Create a file named `translation.properties` for your default language (e.g., English) and place it in your plugin's classpath (e.g., the same directory as your script).

    **`translation.properties`:**
    ```properties
    view.title=DILA AI Markup Assistant
    actions.menu=Actions
    ai.markup.action=AI Markup
    # ... other keys
    ```

    For other languages, create suffixed files like `translation_fr.properties` for French.

2.  **Update `dila-ai-markup.js`:** Modify your script to use `PluginResourceBundle` to load these properties. This will automatically select the correct language file based on Oxygen's current locale.

````javascript
// ...existing code...
    var pluginDirPath = pluginDir.getAbsolutePath();

    // Get the resource bundle for the plugin.
    // It will automatically load the correct translation_{lang}.properties file.
    var resourceBundle = pluginWorkspaceAccess.getPluginResourceBundle("com.dila.ai.markup");

    // Function to get translation by key
    function i18nFn(key) {
        try {
            var translated = resourceBundle.getMessage(key);
            return translated || key;
        } catch (e) {
            logDebug("Translation key not found: " + key);
            return key; // fallback: return key if not found
        }
    }

    // Check for DEBUG setting from environment variable or system property
    getDebugMode();
// ...existing code...
```

### Summary of Changes:

1.  **Get Resource Bundle:** I've added a line to get the `PluginResourceBundle` using `pluginWorkspaceAccess.getPluginResourceBundle("com.dila.ai.markup")`. You should use your actual plugin ID.
2.  **Updated `i18nFn`:** The `i18nFn` function is now much simpler. It calls `resourceBundle.getMessage(key)` to get the translated string. This handles the logic of finding the right language file and the specific key.
3.  **Removed Manual Parsing:** You can now delete all the code related to manually finding, loading, and parsing `translation.xml` with `DocumentBuilderFactory`.

This approach is more efficient and aligns with standard Java and Oxygen plugin development practices.// filepath: c:\Project\OCR2Markup\Models\Gemini2.5\dilaAIMarkupPlugin\dila-ai-markup.js
// ...existing code...
    var pluginDirPath = pluginDir.getAbsolutePath();

    // Get the resource bundle for the plugin.
    // It will automatically load the correct translation_{lang}.properties file.
    var resourceBundle = pluginWorkspaceAccess.getPluginResourceBundle("com.dila.ai.markup");

    // Function to get translation by key
    function i18nFn(key) {
        try {
            var translated = resourceBundle.getMessage(key);
            return translated || key;
        } catch (e) {
            logDebug("Translation key not found: " + key);
            return key; // fallback: return key if not found
        }
    }

    // Check for DEBUG setting from environment variable or system property
    getDebugMode();
// ...existing code...
```
