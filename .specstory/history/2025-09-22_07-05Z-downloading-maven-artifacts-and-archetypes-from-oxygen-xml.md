_**Assistant**_

To download Maven artifacts and archetypes from the Oxygen XML SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Find the Maven coordinates**: On the [Oxygen XML SDK download page](https://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen_sdk/download.html), look for the Maven groupId, artifactId, and version for the desired SDK or archetype.

2. **Add to your `pom.xml`**: Include the dependency in your Maven project's `pom.xml` file. For example:
````xml
<!-- Add this to your pom.xml dependencies section -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>ro.sync</groupId>
    <artifactId>oxygen-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>YOUR_VERSION_HERE</version>
</dependency>
````

3. **Configure Maven repository (if needed)**: If Oxygen artifacts are not in Maven Central, add their repository to your `pom.xml`:
````xml
<!-- Add this to your pom.xml repositories section -->
<repository>
    <id>oxygen-repo</id>
    <url>https://maven.oxygenxml.com/</url>
</repository>
````

4. **Download archetypes**: To use an archetype, run in your terminal:
````shell
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=ro.sync -DarchetypeArtifactId=oxygen-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=YOUR_VERSION_HERE
````

Replace `YOUR_VERSION_HERE` with the version you want.

**Summary:**  
- Check the Oxygen XML SDK page for Maven coordinates and repository info.
- Add the dependency and repository to your `pom.xml`.
- Use Maven commands to download artifacts or generate projects from archetypes.

- You can find these on the project's website, documentation, or [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/).

### 2. **Add Dependencies to `pom.xml`**
- For each artifact, add a dependency block in your `pom.xml`:
````xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>example.group</groupId>
    <artifactId>example-artifact</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
````

### 3. **Add Archetype Information**
- To use an archetype, you need its groupId, artifactId, and version.
- Run this command in your terminal:
````shell
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=example.group -DarchetypeArtifactId=example-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0
````

### 4. **Configure Repositories (if needed)**
- If the artifact is not in Maven Central, add the repository to your `pom.xml`:
````xml
<repository>
    <id>custom-repo</id>
    <url>https://repo.example.com/maven2</url>
</repository>
````

### 5. **Download Artifacts**
- Run `mvn install` or `mvn dependency:resolve` to download all dependencies.

### 6. **Reference Documentation**
- Check the official documentation for each artifact/archetype for usage details.

**Summary:**  
- Gather Maven coordinates for each artifact/archetype.
- Add dependencies and repositories to your `pom.xml`.
