The last command `gh --help` attempted to display help information for the GitHub CLI tool, but it failed because the `gh` command is not installed on your Windows system.

The error message indicates that PowerShell cannot find the `gh` executable - it's not recognized as a cmdlet, function, script file, or program. This means the GitHub CLI is not installed or not added to your system's PATH environment variable.

To fix this, you would need to install the GitHub CLI first. You can do this using one of these methods:

**Using winget (Windows Package Manager):**
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

**Using Chocolatey:**
```powershell
choco install gh
```

**Using Scoop:**
```powershell
scoop install gh
```

**Or download directly from GitHub:**
Download the installer from https://cli.github.com/

After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or refresh your PATH environment variable for the `gh` command to be recognized.

how to refresh my PATH environment variable for the gh command to be recognized?

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

To refresh your PATH environment variable in Windows so the `gh` command is recognized, you have several options:

## Method 1: Restart Your Terminal
The simplest approach is to close and reopen your terminal/PowerShell window. This will automatically load the updated PATH.

## Method 2: Refresh PATH in Current PowerShell Session
You can refresh the PATH without restarting by running this command in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PATH = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH","User")
```

## Method 3: Use refreshenv (if using Chocolatey)
If you have Chocolatey installed, you can use:

```powershell
refreshenv
```

## Method 4: Manually Add to Current Session
If you know where GitHub CLI was installed, you can temporarily add it to the current session:

```powershell
$env:PATH += ";C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI"
```

## Method 5: Restart Windows Explorer
As a last resort, you can restart Windows Explorer to refresh system-wide environment variables:

```powershell
# Kill and restart explorer
taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
start explorer.exe
```

After using any of these methods, try running `gh --help` again to verify the command is now recognized.

how to get env PATH?

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

Here are several ways to get the current PATH environment variable in Windows:

## Method 1: PowerShell
```powershell
$env:PATH
```

Or to display it in a more readable format (one path per line):
```powershell
$env:PATH -split ';'
```

## Method 2: Command Prompt (cmd)
```cmd
echo %PATH%
```

## Method 3: Get Both User and System PATH Separately
```powershell
# Get system-wide PATH
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine")

# Get user-specific PATH
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "User")

# Get combined PATH (what's actually used)
[System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH")
```

## Method 4: Using PowerShell to Format Output Nicely
```powershell
# Display all PATH entries numbered
$env:PATH -split ';' | ForEach-Object { $i=0 } { "$($i): $_"; $i++ }
```

## Method 5: Search for Specific Program in PATH
```powershell
# Check if a specific program (like 'gh') is in PATH
$env:PATH -split ';' | Where-Object { Test-Path "$_\gh.exe" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }
```

The most common and simple way is just using `$env:PATH` in PowerShell or `echo %PATH%` in Command Prompt.
